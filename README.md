# The kUSD repo is currently private

After much deliberation we've decided to make the kcoin mining client closed-source for the time being. We realise that in order for kUSD to be fully automonmous, publically verifiable and maximally secure it must be open source &mdash; and we fully intend to make it so later on.

For now, though, if you'd like to see or contribute to the source code, please contact us. We love talking about our project, and we welcome anyone who wants to contribute.
